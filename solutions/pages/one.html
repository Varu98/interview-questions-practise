      <p>
        So I wanted To join neogcamp in previous year only but i could not get
        past the interview round, i hadnt practised for the interview and while
        giving the interview last year i had to practise more on javascript.
      </p>
      <p>
        last year i had this figured that web dev could get me a job without too
        much emphasis on the data structures part and i love to develop so and
        neog can help in achieving the same through hardwork and practise.
