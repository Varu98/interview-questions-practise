So I wanted To join neogcamp in previous year only but i could not get past the interview round, i hadnt practised for the interview and while giving the interview last year i had to practise more on javascript.

last year i had this figured that web dev could get me a job without too much emphasis on the data structures part and i love to develop so and neog can help in achieving the same through hardwork and practise.
